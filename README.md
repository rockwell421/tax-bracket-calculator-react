# tax-bracket-calculator-react
A Canadian tax bracket calculator written in React

Since most of us Quebecers have difficulty understanding how much tax we pay as employees, as well as how much we might be getting back, i thought that it would be useful to write an application that calculates this.

The beta version will be a simple calculation app based on your annual income.

It will break down how much federal and provincial tax you pay and display it on the screen.
